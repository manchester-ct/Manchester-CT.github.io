            <h1> Tricategorical Universal Properties Via Enriched Homotopy Theory </h1>
            <h2>Adrian Miranda </h2>
                <p> When considering (co)limits of categories, one might ask for (co)cones to only commute up to natural isomorphism, or for universal properties to only hold up to equivalences of categories. In a general bicategory K such universal properties are modelled by the notion of a bicategorical (co)limit, where weights and diagrams only ever impose equations/relations on data in the highest available dimension. However, these notions can also be modelled up to equivalence via ordinary (co)limits enriched over V= Cat, provided that one restricts their attention to weights that are well behaved with respect to the canonical monoidal model structure on V.

                    In this talk I will explain how the above story adapts to the setting involving (co)limits *of* two-dimensional categories (or more generally, *in* three-dimensional categories). This involves homotopically well-behaved (co)limits enriched over the base V now given by Lack's monoidal model structure on the category of 2-categories and 2-functors. Running examples for motivation include Kleisli and Eilenberg-Moore constructions for pseudomonads, including for those on monoidal bicategories, as well as strictification constructions on bicategories and pseudo-double categories. This talk is based on my recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01837">preprint</a>.</p>
